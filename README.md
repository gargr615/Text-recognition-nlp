Text Classification is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves automatically categorizing text into predefined labels or classes.
It enables machines to understand, organize, and make decisions based on textual data.

Common applications include:

Spam Detection (spam vs. not spam)

Sentiment Analysis (positive, negative, neutral)

Topic Categorization (sports, politics, technology, etc.)

Intent Detection in chatbots

Toxic Comment Detection or Fake News Identification

## üìù Introduction

In text classification, each document (sentence, paragraph, or article) is represented numerically so that machine learning or deep learning models can process it.

The general workflow:

Data Collection ‚Äì Gather labeled text data.

Preprocessing ‚Äì Clean text (remove stop words, punctuation, lowercasing, etc.).

Feature Extraction ‚Äì Convert text into numeric form (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings).

Model Training ‚Äì Use ML/DL models like Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, LSTM, BERT.

Evaluation ‚Äì Assess using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Deployment ‚Äì Integrate the trained model into applications (APIs, chatbots, etc.).
